##caveat

I don't have exact dates and numbers, often, as I'd prefered to hope Jemmifer would have been kinder to Jemima

##points

1. Waited until Tuesday June 22 before saying anything about telling Jemima "on the weekend"
1. Only told me that she'd after saying she'd spoken to the solicitor about extending the settlement date to mid-August

##predictions

Will demonise the buyers because it will become their fault Jemima's birthday is diminished if they don't agree to extend the settlement.
